  Welcome to my GitHub Repository! I am an Assistant Professor of Finance at Smeal College of Business, Pennsylvania State University.   
  I conduct empirical research on Economics of Privacy, Conversational-AI, Counterfeit Products, Branding, and Law and Finance.  
  My work has been published at academic journals such as the Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, and presented at conferences such as the NBER, AFA, MFA, ALEA, and AAA. 
  This page will host code and data from my research projects. I plan to update it in due course. All items are licensed under the MIT License.
